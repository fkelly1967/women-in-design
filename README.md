<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My work is play. And I play when I design. I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure that I actually do that, and the definition of &#39;play,&#39; number one, was &#39;engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor,&#39; and number two was &#39;gambling.&#39; And I realize I do both when I&#39;m designing&quot; ― Paula Scher</p>
